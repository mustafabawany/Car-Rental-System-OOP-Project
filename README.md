# Car-Rental-System-OOP-Project

### Introduction
Our project is a replica of the Careem/Uber and other Taxi service applications. We also added a concept of car-pooling between pickup and Drop-off locations which is not offered by the cab service company and it can be implemented to generate more revenue.

### Goal:
* The project aims to understand the practical problems of the world and implement the acquired knowledge of C++ to work on Booking systems
* Careem and Uber are clear examples of Car booking systems but we would introduce a car pooling system along with the car booking.

### Tools and technologies used
* IDE: Visual Studio Code /Dev C++
* For Interface: Qt Creator Software.

### Future work
•	We would like to use the concept of Relational Database in place of txt files.
•	For the front-end we would to integrate our backend and frontend through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS instead of using a software.
•	Also , in the near future as soon as we get good hands on java, we would use Android Studio to work on an application interface.
